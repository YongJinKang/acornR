### 1. Outline

  - This statistical tests are for comparing the variances of two or more samples. 
  - Equal variances across samples is called **homogeneity of variances**.
  - Some statistical tests, such as **two independent samples T-test** and **ANOVA test**, assume that variances are equal across groups. 
  - The **Bartlett’s test**, **Levene’s test** or **Fligner-Killeen’s test** can be used to verify that assumption.

***

### 2. Statistical tests for comparing variances

There are many solutions to test for the equality (homogeneity) of variance across groups, including:

  - **F-test** : Compare the variances of two samples. The data must be normally distributed.
  -  **Bartlett’s test** : Compare the variances of k samples, where k can be more than two samples. The data must be normally distributed. The Levene test is an alternative to the Bartlett test that is less sensitive to departures from normality.
  - **Levene’s test** : Compare the variances of k samples, where k can be more than two samples. It’s an alternative to the Bartlett’s test that is less sensitive to departures from normality.
  - **Fligner-Killeen test** : a non-parametric test which is very robust against departures from normality.

***

### 3. Statistical hypotheses

For all these tests (Bartlett’s test, Levene’s test or Fligner-Killeen’s test),

  - the null hypothesis is that all populations variances are equal.
  - the alternative hypothesis is that at least two of them differ.

### 4. check your data into R

Here, we’ll use `ToothGrowth{datasets}` and `PlantGrowth{datasets}` data sets:  
  To have an idea of what the data look like, we start by displaying a random sample of 10 rows using the function `sample_n{dplyr}`.
    
```{r code1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Load the data
data(ToothGrowth)
data(PlantGrowth)
```

```{r code2, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(123)

# Show PlantGrowth
dplyr::sample_n(PlantGrowth, 10, F)
```

```{r code3, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# PlantGrowth data structure
str(PlantGrowth)
```

```{r code4, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Show ToothGrowth
dplyr::sample_n(ToothGrowth, 10, F)
```

```{r code5, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# ToothGrowth data structure
str(ToothGrowth)
```
  
**Note** that R considers the column `dose` in `ToothGrowth{datasets}` as a numeric vector.  
We want to convert it as a grouping variable (factor).

```{r code6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ToothGrowth$dose <- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
```

### 5. Compute Bartlett’s test in R

  - **Bartlett’s test** is used for testing homogeneity of variances in k samples, where k can be more than two. It’s adapted for normally distributed data. The Levene test, described in the next section, is a more robust alternative to the Bartlett test when the distributions of the data are non-normal.
  
  - The R function `bartlett.test()` can be used to compute **Barlett’s test**. The simplified format is as follow:

    + `bartlett.test(formula, data)`
  
        + formula: a formula of the form `values ~ groups`
        + data: a matrix or data frame

  - The function returns a list containing the following component:
    + **statistic** : Bartlett’s K-squared test statistic
    + **parameter** : the degrees of freedom of the approximate chi-squared distribution of the test statistic.
    + **p.value**   : the p-value of the test
<p/>

  - To perform the test, we’ll use the `PlantGrowth{datasets}`, which contains the weight of plants obtained under 3 treatment groups.
  
    + **Bartlett’s test with one independent variable**:
    
```{r code7, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
( res <- bartlett.test(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth) )
```
  - From the output, it can be seen that the p-value of 0.2370968 is not less than the significance level of 0.05. This means that there is no evidence to suggest that the variance in plant growth is statistically significantly different for the three treatment groups.   
      
  - **Bartlett’s test** with multiple independent variables :  
  the `interaction{base}` function must be used to collapse multiple factors into a single variable containing all combinations of the factors.
      
```{r code8, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
bartlett.test(len ~ interaction(supp,dose), data=ToothGrowth)
```

***

### 6. Compute Levene’s test in R

  - **Levene’s test** is an alternative to **Bartlett’s test** when the data is not normally distributed.
  
  - The function `leveneTest{car}` can be used.
  
```{r code9, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(car)

# Levene's test with one independent variable
leveneTest(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
```

```{r code10, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Levene's test with multiple independent variables
leveneTest(len ~ supp*dose, data = ToothGrowth)
```

***

### 7. Compute Fligner-Killeen test in R

  - The **Fligner-Killeen test** is one of the many tests for homogeneity of variances which is most robust against departures from normality.
  
  - The R function `fligner.test()` can be used to compute the test:
  
```{r code11, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
fligner.test(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
```
