### This chapter describes statistical tests to use for comparing means.

#### These tests include:

  - T-test  
  - Wilcoxon test  
  - ANOVA test and  
  - Kruskal-Wallis test  

***

### 1. How this chapter is organized?

  - Comparing one-sample mean to a standard known mean:
    + One-Sample T-test ($\color{red}{parametric}$)
    + One-Sample Wilcoxon Test ($\color{blue}{non-parametric}$)
  - Comparing the means of two independent groups:
    + Unpaired Two Samples T-test ($\color{red}{parametric}$)
    + Unpaired Two-Samples Wilcoxon Test ($\color{blue}{non-parametric}$)
  - Comparing the means of paired samples:
    + Paired Samples T-test ($\color{red}{parametric}$)
    + Paired Samples Wilcoxon Test ($\color{blue}{non-parametric}$)
  - Comparing the means of more than two groups
    + Analysis of variance (ANOVA, $\color{red}{parametric}$):
      + One-Way ANOVA Test in R
      + Two-Way ANOVA Test in R
      + MANOVA Test in R: Multivariate Analysis of Variance
    + Kruskal-Wallis Test in R ($\color{blue}{non-parametric}$ alternative to one-way ANOVA)
