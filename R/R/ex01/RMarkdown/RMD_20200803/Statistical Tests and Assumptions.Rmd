>Here we’ll describe **research questions** and the corresponding **statistical tests**, as well as, the **test assumptions**. 

***

### Research questions and corresponding statistical tests

#### 1. The **most popular** research questions include:

  - whether **two variables** (n = 2) are correlated (i.e., associated)
  - whether **multiple variables** (n > 2) are correlated
  - whether **two groups** (n = 2) of samples differ from each other
  - whether **multiple groups** (n >= 2) of samples differ from each other
  - whether the **variability** of two samples differ

***

#### 2. Each of these questions can be answered using the following statistical tests:

  - **Correlation test** between **two** variables
  - **Correlation matrix** between **multiple** variables
  - **Comparing the means** of **two** groups:
    + **Student’s t-test** (parametric)
    + **Wilcoxon rank test** (non-parametric)
  - **Comparing the means** of **more than two** groups
    + **ANOVA test** (analysis of variance, parametric): extension of **t-test** to compare more than two groups.
    + **Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test** (non-parametric): extension of **Wilcoxon rank test** to compare more than two groups
  - Comparing the variances:
    + Comparing the variances of two groups: **F-test** (parametric)
    + Comparison of the variances of more than two groups: **Bartlett’s test** (parametric), **Levene’s test** (parametric) and **Fligner-Killeen test** (non-parametric)

*** 

#### 3. Statistical test requirements (assumptions)

  - Many of the statistical procedures including correlation, regression, t-test, and analysis of variance assume some certain characteristic about the data. Generally they assume that:

    - the data are normally distributed
    - and the variances of the groups to be compared are **homogeneous** (equal).

>These assumptions should be taken seriously to draw reliable interpretation and conclusions of the research.

>These tests - **correlation**, **t-test** and **ANOVA** - are called **parametric tests**, because their validity depends on the distribution of the data.

  - Before using parametric test, we should perform some preleminary tests to make sure that the test assumptions are met. In the situations where the assumptions are violated, **non-paramatric** tests are recommended.

#### 4. How to assess the normality of the data?

  - With large enough sample sizes (**n > 30**) the violation of the normality assumption should not cause major problems (**central limit theorem**). This implies that we can ignore the distribution of the data and use parametric tests.

  - However, to be consistent, we can use Shapiro-Wilk’s significance test comparing the sample distribution to a normal one in order to ascertain whether data show or not a serious deviation from normality.

***

#### 5. How to assess the equality of variances?

  - The standard **Student’s t-test** (comparing two independent samples) and the **ANOVA test** (comparing multiple samples) assume also that the samples to be compared have equal variances.

  - If the samples, being compared, follow normal distribution, then it’s possible to use:
  
    + **F-test** to compare the variances of two samples
    + **Bartlett’s Test** or **Levene’s Test** to compare the variances of multiple samples.
