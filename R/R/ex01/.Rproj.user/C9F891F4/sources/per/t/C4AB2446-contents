#### This chapter contains articles for computing and visualizing correlation analyses in R. Recall that, correlation analysis is used to investigate the association between two or more variables. A simple example, is to evaluate whether there is a link between maternal age and childâ€™s weight at birth.

### 2. Correlation Matrix: Analyze, Format and Visualize

  - Correlation matrix is used to analyze the correlation between multiple variables at the same time.
  
  - Brief outline:  
      + What is correlation matrix?  
      + Compute correlation matrix in R  
      + R functions  
      + Compute correlation matrix  
      + Correlation matrix with significance levels (p-value)  
      + A simple function to format the correlation matrix  
      + Visualize correlation matrix  
        + Use `symnum{stats}` function: Symbolic number coding
        + Use `corrplot{corrplot}` function: Draw a correlogram
        + Use `chart.Correlation{PerformanceAnalytics}` function: Draw scatter plots
        + Use `heatmap{stats}` function

### 3. Visualize Correlation Matrix using Correlogram

  - Correlogram
    + is a graph of correlation matrix.
    + is useful to highlight the most correlated variables in a data table.
  - In this plot, correlation coefficients are colored according to the value.
  - Correlation matrix can be also reordered according to the degree of association between variables.
  - Brief outline:
    + Install R corrplot package  
    + Data for correlation analysis  
    + Computing correlation matrix  
    + Correlogram : Visualizing the correlation matrix  
    + Visualization methods  
    + Types of correlogram layout  
    + Reordering the correlation matrix  
    + Changing the color of the correlogram  
    + Changing the color and the rotation of text labels  
    + Combining correlogram with the significance test  
    + Customize the correlogram  
      
```{r code1, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(corrplot)
library(RColorBrewer)

( M <-cor(mtcars) )

corrplot(M, type="upper", order="hclust", col=brewer.pal(n=8, name="RdYlBu"))
```

### 4. Elegant Correlation Table using xtable R Package

  - The aim of this article is to show you how to get the lower and the upper triangular part of a correlation matrix. 
  - We will use also `{xtable}` R package to display a nice correlation table.
  - Brief outline:  
    + Correlation matrix analysis  
    + Lower and upper triangular part of a correlation matrix  
    + Use `{xtable}` R package to display nice correlation table in html format  
    + Combine matrix of correlation coefficients and significance levels
